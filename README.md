# Hello! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I am Amir, who loves analysing big data and building smart products in the field of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Science, and Robotics.  I have collaborated as a researcher, computer vision, and NLP engineer with 5+ years of experience in academic and research environments. I have a great passion for high-tech solutions to address real-world problems with my background in NLP, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning. In recent years, I have focused on the field of natural language processing and computer vision as an intermediate field because I believe that sooner or later AI will inevitably impact all aspects of our lives, particularly how people make communication and share knowledge.
