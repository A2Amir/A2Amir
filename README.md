Hi, I am Amir, who loves analysing big data and building smart products in the field of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.  I have collaborated as a researcher, computer vision and NLP engineer with 4+ years of experience in academic and research environments. I have a great passion for high-tech solutions to address real-world problems with my background in NLP, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning. In recent years, I have focused on the field of natural language because I believe that sooner or later AI will inevitably impact all aspects of our lives, particularly how people make communication and share knowledge.




Recently, i completed my second master's degree in Web Communication and Information System with a successful master's thesis, which dealt with the analysis of satellite images and computer vision and a 8 month nano master degree as a Self-Driving Car Engineer. I worked as research assitant at the University of Applied Science FH kufstein and finished a 5 month and a 3 month nano master degrees at Udacity, which deal with analyzing of big data and natural language processing. I would like to combine my passion for learning and teaching with my development skills to continue building smart products for people.
